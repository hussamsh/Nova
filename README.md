## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

NOVA is a cryptographic application that enables encryption and decryption of images using latest technologies - mainly **Chaotic maps**.

*Nova offers three chaotic maps that can be used for encryption / decryption*
* **Logistic map** 
  Based on Robert May's [work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237005499_Simple_Mathematical_Models_With_Very_Complicated_Dynamics) back in 1976, the logistic map is the most iconic and heavily researched chaotic maps in his history.
* **Double humped map**
  Popularized by [Coiteux](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/61733598.pdf) in 2014, the double humped map shows a double hump in it's first iteration - hence the name - and exhibits some unique behavior that mkes it highly suitable for cryptogragic operations.
* **Tent map**
    Based on Robert May's [work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237005499_Simple_Mathematical_Models_With_Very_Complicated_Dynamics) back in 1976, the logistic map is the most iconic and heavily researched chaotic maps in his history.
